      <div id="accordionh2">
        <h2>History</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The idea of BasiC did not born from the nothing, it has a lot of history behind, and in this section, you are going to know it.</p>
          <p>The first that you have to know about BasiC is that Basic was not BasiC at the beginning, the first idea of BasiC was called <strong>CeC</strong> (<strong>C</strong>omando <strong>E</strong>spañol de <strong>C</strong>ombate), translated in English as Spanish Combat Squad.</p>
          <p><img src="./images/ceclogo.jpg" alt="Logo Comando Español de Combate" class="news" /></p>
          <p>This first name and clan came up in the start of 2006. My brother in law and myself was in a clan called <strong>WWK</strong>, but we decided to create a new project, start from the scracht, so we left <strong>WWK</strong>, a great comunity of friends, to embark in a new and risky project.</p>
          <p>We were not alone of course, we had another two partners but we needed more people, so we started to do publicity and gradually we were earning members.</p>
          <p>After a time, another clan showed up, #Iberos#, and we decided to make a fusion between the two clans, and that way BasiC borned.</p>
          <p>This is a really summarized history of BasiC, if you want to kwnow more... join us and be part of its!</p>
          <p>You can also download the original .doc with a fiction history about how basic born using this <a href="./resources/history.doc">link</a>.</p>
        </div>
        <h2>Statutes</h2>
        <div>
          <p>The statutes of 'BasiC | Clan! should be known by all its members, they were written with the intention of a better maintenance of the clan and are subject to revision whenever there is a good idea or a fault was discovered. Nobody is perfect, not even their author.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>BasiC was born oficially August 21 2006, from the fusion of #Iberos# and CeC.</li>
            <li>Within our server should have to carry the initials of BasiC respecting the color and style of the tag: within other servers you can do whatever you want, although please ask for the proper recognition of the clan to continue carrying the tag.</li>
            <li>Anyone can apply for membership in the Clan. he had to be a period of cadet 'BasiC! during which he must have a temporary tag, still maintaining his nick; he must also demonstrate a minimum of skill in the game and especially prove their worth as a person. During this period he must obbey the rules and regulations as any other clan member. Once accepted as a full member of 'BasiC! he can dress the tag 'BasiC! and colors.
              During this trial period is possible that the cadet may even get to play a war with the Clan, as long as there is no available member and / or available members so they see fit.</li>
            <li> The Clan will consist of three departments: Technical, treasury and foreign relations.
              <ul>
                <li><strong>Technical</strong>: game, TS and web server maintenance and contact with the host company.</li>
                <li><strong>Treasury</strong>: responsible for managing and keeping accounts of the clan.
                  <ul>
                    <li>Period of payment: the payment period will begin on the 15th of the month prior to payment and will expire on the 30th, after this date players who will not have paid they will be excluded from the clan. If someone can not make the payments should be advised beforehand, it might be possible that these members were reinstated if would prove that the delay was for good cause</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li><strong>External relations</strong>: responsible for contact with other clans, manage the recruitment period and learn about tournaments and leagues.</li>
              </ul>
            <li>In Clan meetings must be made with a minimum of five members of which at least 3 must be Admins and for something to be approved shall receive a minimum of 50% of the votes. After the meeting, this will be published as soon as possible in the corresponding section of the forum.</li>

        <h2>Code of conduct</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Code of conduct are mandatory for everyone, whether or not belong to the clan, while they are inside our server:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Respect and be respected, both within and outside our server you should treat others as you would like they treat to you.</li>
            <li>Within our TS we can talk about what you want, always respecting the rooms, but within the server speak exclusively of the game.</li>
            <li>Do not abuse the game chat for private conversations.</li>
            <li>The TS is public and can be used by anyone, provided he is playing in our server, because this will give much more life to the game and gives us the opportunity to know each other more.</li>
            <li> It is forbidden the use of "cheats" or "bug" of the game.</li>
            <li>Respect the play mode of the other: All weapons are activated and there is no rule "anti-campers" as long as an admin does not say otherwise.</li>
            <li>Spectator mode for long periods can lead to expulsion from the server, especially if it is full. </li>
            <li>Good vibes and fun, this is a clan and a server where we can all improve and learn from others. </li>
          </ul>

        <h2>Entrance exams</h2>
        <div>
          <p>Prior to entrance exams the interested has to read the statutes of the clan and agrees with them, if not, he could not get in the clan.</p>
          <p>All tests were carried out with a clan member in spectator to observe the recruit.</p>
          <p>If the person who wants to enter the clan is sponsored by an active member of the clan, he will have preference over any other recruits who also want to enter.</p>
          <p>If the recruit does not pass any of these tests, a special meeting would be conducted to decide the entrance of the recruit in the clan.</p>
          <p>If the recruit get in the clan, by meeting or passing the tests, he will have to carry the recruit  tag during a month.</p>
          <p>The tests that he has to pass depends on the main game that the interested would like to play. But for the Call of Duty 2: the tests are the next:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>1st Test (bolt action rifle)</strong>: The interested must show his skill with the bolt action rifle with three clan members who tried to kill him using melee hits, he can not use the gun. If he reach 5 kills without having achieved 10 points this test will be fail. </li>
            <li><strong>2nd Test (Melee hits)</strong>: There will be a melee hits struggle between the recruit and a clan member. If the recruit kill him 5 times before the clan member reaches that same score he will have passed the test.</li>
            <li><strong>3rd Test (DM bolt action rifles or snipers)</strong>: the recruit should play a DM (deathmatch) using only bolt action rifles or sniper with 3 other clan members, he should get at least 10 points to pass this test. </li>
            <li><strong>4th Test (DM submachine gun)</strong>: As the 3rd test but this time with submachine gun</li>
            <li><strong>5th Test (SD game mode)</strong>: In this last test, and probably the most important the recruit must show his skills in the search and destroy, (gameplay majority in tournaments).</li>
          </ul>
